### Hello there 👋

**A Mobile Software Engineer currently working @SoyMomo where we *mostly* develop safe technology for kids**

### Little bit about me 🌳
:book:  I'm on track with learning more about DataOps, MLOps, DevOps and Software Architecture.

✍️  In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, playing football, learning about investments and trying to be financially literate.
